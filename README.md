### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a hobbyist programmer. I love and enjoy Python. I'm a problem solver, and I enjoy creative solutions. I started teaching myself programming at the age of 12 after learning about the existence of SICP, and I've been hooked ever since.

I primarily work in food service, maybe someday I can become a professional programmer. 

Interests:
* Genetic Algorithms / Genetic Programming 
* Data Science / Data Mining / Scraping
* Game AI
